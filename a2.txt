Renaissance art is the painting, sculpture and decorative arts of the period of European history 
known as the Renaissance, which emerged as a distinct style in Italy in about AD 1400, in parallel with
 developments which occurred in philosophy, literature, music, science and technology. Renaissance art, 
perceived as the noblest of ancient traditions, took as its foundation the art of Classical antiquity, 
but transformed that tradition by absorbing recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and 
by applying contemporary scientific knowledge. Along with Renaissance humanist philosophy, it spread throughout Europe,
 affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities. 
For art historians, Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the Early Modern age.
